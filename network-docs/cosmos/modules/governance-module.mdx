- **Importance**: Empowers community members to shape the future of the network through democratic processes.

## Key Functionalities
- **Proposal Submission**: Allows participants to submit proposals for network changes or improvements.
- **Voting Mechanism**: Enables token holders to vote on proposals, ensuring community-driven decision-making.
- **Proposal Types**: Supports various types of proposals, including software upgrades, parameter changes, and community funding requests.

## Usage and Examples

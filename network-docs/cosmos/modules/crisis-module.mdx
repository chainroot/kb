# Crisis Module in Cosmos Network

The Crisis module is an integral part of the Cosmos network, designed to maintain network integrity during emergencies. This document delves into the Crisis module, its functionalities, and its critical role in the Cosmos ecosystem.

## Overview of the Crisis Module
- **Purpose**: Activates in response to critical situations to safeguard the network's integrity.
- **Functionality**: Implements mechanisms to halt the blockchain under specific emergency conditions.

## Key Functionalities
- **Emergency Response**: Triggers network halts in response to severe issues, such as invariant breaches.
- **Invariant Checking**: Monitors for critical conditions that could compromise the network's stability.

## Usage and Examples
- **Configuring Invariants**: Guide on setting up and managing invariants within the network.
- **Emergency Procedures**: Overview of steps taken by the module during crisis situations.

## Best Practices
- **Regular Monitoring**: Recommendations for monitoring network health and invariants.
- **Crisis Preparedness**: Tips for preparing and responding to emergency scenarios in the network.
